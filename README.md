# dynamic_selector
Hi all!
So my todo list looks:
Jquery or Fetch, because it's a local file, i decided to take jquery library.
1. To make dynamic selector with requests to a local json file.
2. Three selection fields which depends to each other.
    a. Make loop function to determine main categories for the first selection field.
    b. Push data to html structure.
    c. Second function wich will depend from first(main field), if it's not empty function will choose included data.
    d. So the third one will watch for the first and second field.
3. Images i think must have function wich will watch for 1,2,3 fields and according to unique id will make a request for exact pic id.


I think that this project must work this way. There is also some ability to use React with different files fuctions and inmport them to a app file.
